face recognition

------

This software was run on ubuntu 14.04 with boost and opencv installed from repo(binary
uses these libraries). It was developed in qtcreator. For program to work correctly one should provide file
haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml from data directory to directory in which the binary is
run(in my case it was ../build-<<qt_project_name>>-Desktop-Debug, where << and >> are not
part of directory name)
